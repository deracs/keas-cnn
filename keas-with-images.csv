1,White C on Orange,"Two kea were caught together at Red Tarns on the slopes of Mt Sebastapol in mid-March 2019. These two young birds, most likely brother and sister, were named Scotty and Adriana after a wonderful couple from the area who have been heavily involved in conservation for many years. 

Scott Theobold died tragically in a helicopter accident in Oct 2018, along with two others (Paul Hondelink and pilot Nick Wallis). We dedicate this to Scotty, Adriana and their family and recognise that what Scott has achieved in conservation progress has been tremendous. His work includes pioneering the use of predator detection dogs in NZ. His first work was training dogs to detect stoats - one of the kea's biggest predators. 

Adriana came to help out with some kea catching with us and Corey Mosen (the kea guru) at Red Tarns a year or so back, and was one of the most wonderful, enthusiastic, positive people you will ever meet.

Kea love feeding on the fruits of montane and alpine plants, especially with juicy attractive berries like this one. They are the most important seed dispersers for a range of these plants and the NZ flora might well suffer in the long term if kea are in decline. Aristotelia's pink bands match the fruit of this beautiful plant too.

152,Yellow A on Black,"Phillip is named after one of the local DOC rangers who worked along the Milford Highway during the summer of 2018/2019. Phillip writes poetry and wrote a special poem for our kea work while we were banding these birds...

THE BANDED KEA

The kea ventured down from the low mound,
to where cast-about food is commonly found.
to get about warily on the flat ground,
a hippity hop and sometimes a bound.

Waiting around patiently, was a lass with a noose,
her strings were all set and the loop was all loose.
A hesitant step inside the carefully laid line,
a quick tug of the rope and ‘you are all mine’

The kea jumped into the air - quite high,
and issued a squawk, and then tried to fly.
Tension on the line and back down with a thump,
an undignified landing on a green feathered rump.

Before she had time to get over the fright,
she was grabbed from behind and gathered up tight.
She went all floppy and pretended to be meek, 
but for the unwary, she attacked with her beak.

A pretty coloured bracelet- just above the claw,
not put on too tightly, in case it goes raw.
She was banded and blooded and ID’d as a bird,
and all throughout this, barely a peep was heard.

Measured and weighed and plucked like a duck,
an extra feather or two, just for good luck.
Time now to release her, back to her own kind,
a few more to catch, but first we must find. 

Many things harm the birds, including old lead,
food given with love, but not what should be fed.
Kea have to be monitored, this is an absolute must, 
thanks to the efforts of the Kea Conservation Trust.

You too can help, with donations and time,
but whatever you do, remember this rhyme.
Bad food will hurt them, as will a loss of their home,
if you see them abused, give us a call on your phone.

Sam McLeod, one of life’s good bugger’s, lost his battle with cancer passing away in Wanaka recently. Sam was part of the Goat Pass crew for the Coast to Coast for a number of years. Sam flew in as part of the pest eradication team, usually staying in and around the area for up to a week after everyone else had left the Hut.

With his outdoor and bush skills, Sam could help out with any situation that could/did arise. Sam would be helping out in and around the hut all day, making cups of tea or coffee for everyone. Also out there helping with the gear checks when first introduced. By night, sitting on the deck teaching people the different calls of the Kiwi, then out trapping and pest control until the early hours of the morning, often getting back after 3am. Sam being Sam, a few hours sleep and then up again to help out with anything that needed doing.

Without the dedication from Sam and the team the Blue Duck, Kiwi and other wildlife would not have been able to increase in numbers to what it is today. Sam’s last flight to Goat Pass with the crew was in 2015, having been diagnosed with cancer and on treatment/medication, he wanted to make one last trip - on his terms.

The Arthur's Pass community is working on removing lead from key buildings in Arthur's Pass village where kea eat the lead (which tastes sweet to them) and accumulates in their body. Hopefully in a few more years, no more kea will need to be treated for lead poisoining. If you wish to donate to this lead removal project, please contact the Arthur's Pass Wildlife Trust or the Kea Conservation Trust to make a donation.
